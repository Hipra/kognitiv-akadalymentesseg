## 1. Purpose of the guide

Cognitive accessibility has been advocated for by the disability community for quite some time. However, its technical and academic systematisation as a concept is recent. Accessibility has usually been associated to built environment, particularly, to the needs of persons with physical disabilities. The needs of people with visual and hearing disabilities have been progressively included in buildings and urbanism and, above all, in communication and technologies. Cognitive accessibility appears at the last stage to focus on persons with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities.

Article 9 of the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-persons-disabilities) provides broad support to include actions and measures aimed at promoting cognitive accessibility. In fact, Article 2 of the Convention offers a long list of communication solutions that mention some cognitive tools. In other words, this Convention, which provides the basis for legislation in all signatory countries, can be deemed the first step to include cognitive accessibility. However, it lacked a theoretical and conceptual framework to systematise the solutions and their implementation as well as a social and political awareness.

Although the concept is still young, some work has been done. There are guidelines addressing communication and digital content as well as built environments and for service delivery. However, a lot of work still needs to be done in terms of legislation, standards, research and projects about cognitive accessibility.

This guide aims to offer insight on cognitive accessibility and its related concepts for professionals that are not familiar with this field. It provides them with the current existing knowledge and information on the main barriers that people with cognitive accessibility needs face as well as basic guidelines, evaluation methodologies, and existing good practices.

<a id="introduction-to-cognitive-accessibility"></a>

## 3. Introduction to cognitive accessibility

Comprehension is the ability to understand situations and facts, especially in a communication context. It may relate to a specific issue or topic, and also to an environment, context and interaction. Comprehension is a cognitive process human beings are confronted with several thousand times a day. However, some people can experience difficulties with it, such as in the following situations:

- Moving to a country where the spoken language is different from the mother tongue, and that has a different alphabet.
- Places signposted with uncommon pictograms or non-standardised signage.
- Browsing an unstructured website, with an illogic menu or distracting elements such as autoplaying videos, pop-ups or ads.
- Changing a device (i.e. a mobile phone) that names and organises the same settings in a different way compared to an older device.
- Following instructions and conveying meaning from manuals and other information with complex language and terminology.

These are a few examples of cognitive accessibility barriers that can affect anyone. However, for some groups these barriers can be overwhelming and troublesome. For example, persons with intellectual disabilities, older persons experiencing cognitive impairment or persons with learning or language disorders. In these situations, cognitive accessibility solutions are necessary.

The definition of cognitive accessibility varies between sources. The **ISO 21801-1:2020 Cognitive accessibility – Part 1. General guidelines**, defines it as an "extent to which systems (understood as "product, service, or built environment or any combination of them with which the user interacts") can be used by people from a population with the widest range of user needs, cognitive characteristics and capabilities to achieve identified goals in identified contexts of use".

[Spain's modification of the General law on the rights of persons with disabilities and their social inclusion, approved in 2022](https://www.boe.es/eli/es/l/2022/03/31/6), added the concept of cognitive accessibility to the definition of universal accessibility it provides:

**"Cognitive accessibility is included in universal accessibility, understood as the element that allows easy understanding, communication and interaction for all persons. It is established that cognitive accessibility is deployed and made effective through easy reading, alternative and augmentative communication systems, pictograms and other human and technological means available for this purpose."**

Internationally, the works carried out by the [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/task-forces/coga/) (COGA TF) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) are worth mentioning. While this group did not provide a definition for cognitive accessibility, their working documents and guidelines focus on easy-to-use, clear content and navigation, helping users understand and avoiding the reliance on memory.

The existing cognitive accessibility definitions refer to a person's interaction with their context, which is the basis of all accessibility definitions within the social model of disability. Under this model, disability is caused by the society, because there are barriers and people experience the disability interacting with these environments. This model separates from the medical one, that states that a disability is related to an impairment or difference that a person has. The difference lies on the cognitive characteristics, as the **ISO 21801-1:2020** points out, and making things easy to comprehend, communicate and interact with, as stated in the aforementioned Spanish law. Both concepts (cognition and easy-to-use) are the drivers for cognitive accessibility.

**COGA TF guidelines** consider the concepts easy to use, easy to understand, easy to find and making help available for users as drivers to overcome cognitive barriers in digital environments. These solutions should not only depend on devices or technology, but also on human support. However, the meaning of easy and its limits when applied to cognitive accessibility may not be widely accepted or understood. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid relying on opinions instead of facts.

It is important to differentiate between cognitive accessibility and usability. As the [W3C explains](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/), the distinction between both terms is not always clear. Firstly, usability is mainly applicable to digital environments. Secondly, it means easy to use based on criteria such as effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. As previously discussed, cognitive accessibility also refers to making things easy. It involves solutions designed for persons with disabilities to ensure the removal of possible barriers and to facilitate equal access and participation. In other words, the purpose of accessibility is linked to inclusion, while usability is more practical and is part of the accessibility criteria.

Cognitive accessibility is a concept that includes a set of solutions for a long list of barriers associated to the following skills:

| Barrier | Solutions |
|---|---|
| **Information processing and communication** – it refers to the way a person receives information (a written text or an oral communication) and understands it in a given context. | They focus on how easy a message is in both content and form. |
| **Remembering information** – Storing and retrieving information can be problematic for anyone, especially for persons with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities, particularly when the information load is considerable. | Repeating words, limiting the amount of information required or adding simple solutions to find the information needed. |
| **Maintaining attention to process information** – Many people find it difficult to concentrate, and to obtain and process information. Competing stimuli may constitute a distraction. | There are standardised solutions to reduce the information load and sustain focus. |
| **Executive functioning** – this skill is related to planning, organising, decision-making, fulfilling tasks and finishing activities appropriately. It also plays a role in self-management. | Cognitively accessible tools are part of the solution, but human support by facilitators is the other part. Facilitators train persons to perform these tasks, on a daily basis or during a specific situation (i.e. for working). |
| **Reasoning, understanding, abstraction, managing time and using numbers** | Providing specific information, reducing the use of abstract concepts and numbers, and providing tools to manage time efficiently. |
| **Wayfinding in built and digital environments** | Solutions help people find their bearings, feel they are in the right place and prevent them from getting lost. |

Cognitive accessibility benefits everyone. Any person can experience temporary situations that can have an impact on their cognitive skills – for example, feeling stressed because of an illness, accident or experiencing something new such as learning how to use a state-of-the-art technology. However, the absence of cognitive accessibility can have a deep negative impact in some groups. It can prevent them from carrying out many activities and getting access to information, services, and places on equal terms with others, what implies an indirect discrimination. The list is wide and diverse:

- Persons with intellectual disabilities can experience limitations in both the intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour.
- Autistic people can experience barriers in processing communication and information.
- Persons with Acquired Brain Injury can experience difficulties with memory, communication or attention, etc.
- Persons with learning and language disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity, dyslexia, aphasia can experience trouble processing information, concentrating or communicating.
- Older persons with a decline in their cognitive skills may need more time to process and understand information. Some people within this group may have higher cognitive needs due to neurodegenerative disorders and illness, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Additionally, there are some groups that experience temporary situations that may affect their cognitive abilities, such as persons with low literacy or that speak a language other than that of the host country. These groups are also main beneficiaries of these accessible solutions. For all of them, the term applied in this publication is persons with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities, that covers the widest range and show the diversity.

## 4. Cognitive accessibility standards

Cognitive accessibility is still missing from most EU legislation, at both European and Member State levels. Apart from the aforementioned Spanish law, there is a general lack of legislation on this topic. [Germany's Equal Opportunities for People with Disabilities Act](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgg/BJNR146800002.html) only includes an article about comprehension and easy language that requires German public administrations to provide explanations and content in easy language. However, it does not mention other fields of application. [The Swedish Non-Discrimination Act](https://rkrattsbaser.gov.se/sfst?bet=2008:567) has a similar scope, focusing mostly on communication. There are also some Austrian regional laws that mention easy forms to communicate with public administrations. Even though there are some mentions of easy and understandable communication and use in some European accessibility laws – such as the **Directive (EU) 2016/2102** on web and mobile accessibility and the **Directive 2010/13/EU** on audiovisual media services (and its amendment **Directive (EU) 2018/1808**), and a few mandatory provisions in the European Accessibility Act (EAA) (Annex I, sections 1 to 4) – cognitive accessibility is practically non-existent in the current EU legislation on accessibility.

There are a few standards that partly make up for the lack of legislation. As with standards in general, compliance is not mandatory. The standardisation process on cognitive accessibility is quite recent, as it is possible to read in the next pages, where the oldest standard was published in 2014. There are two ISO standards with specific recommendations:

### ISO 21801-1:2020: Cognitive accessibility – Part 1: General guidelines

### ISO 21801-2:2022: Cognitive accessibility – Part 2: Reporting

It has to be said that the core work developed during the first quarter of this century has focused more on written content and pictograms.

Additionally, the [CEN/CENELEC guide 6](https://www.cencenelec.eu/media/Guides/CEN-CLC/cenclcguide6.pdf) in 2014 proposes a list of design considerations to tackle these barriers and implement solutions. Some of the solutions mentioned include aligning information with users' needs, providing feedback channels, appropriate instructions (including start and finish), presenting information in different formats, flexibility of time, easy use and language.

### ISO/IEC 23859:2023: Information technology — User interfaces — Requirements and recommendations on making written text easy-to-read and understand.

### ISO 24495-1:2023: Plain language — Part 1: Governing principles and guidelines.

It is foreseen that the **ISO 24495** on plain language will have a part 2 dealing with legal communication, and a part 3 about science writing. Both standards are expected to be published in 2025 and 2026 respectively.

Spain has published the **UNE 153101:2018 EX Easy-to-read. Guidelines and recommendations for the elaboration of documents**. Germany, on the other hand, is working on the **E DIN SPEC 33429:2023-04**, which is still being drafted.

Regarding pictograms, there is a standard divided in three parts that offers a guideline for testing pictograms but not for designing them:

### ISO 9186-1:2014: Graphical symbols — Test methods — Part 1: Method for testing comprehensibility

### ISO 9186-2:2008: Graphical symbols — Test methods — Part 2: Method for testing perceptual quality

### ISO 9186-3:2014: Graphical symbols — Test methods — Part 3: Method for testing symbol referent association

The **ISO 22727:2007. Graphical symbols – Creation and design of public information symbols – Requirements** specifically offers guidelines for creating and designing public information symbols. While it is not focused on accessibility, it describes the necessary requirements to ensure visual clarity, maintain consistency (linked to comprehensibility) and improve recognition.

Additionally, there are some standards that belong to other fields with some references to cognitive accessibility solutions. For example, the **ISO 21542:2021. Building construction — Accessibility and usability of the built environment** includes recommendations for signage, wayfinding and information in buildings. Also, the **ISO 21802:2019. Assistive products — Guidelines on cognitive accessibility — Daily time management** offers a set of recommendations for a specific barrier: time management and assistive products for it.

There is also some work done regarding cognitive accessibility guidelines to make digital content more accessible. The World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI) developed the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**, widely regarded as the international standard for web accessibility. Two standards that have stemmed from the WCAG are the **ISO/IEC 40500:2012 Information technology — W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0** and the **EN 301 549 Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services**. However, these documents are not based on the current version (WCAG 2.2) but on previous ones, **WCAG 2.0** and **2.1** respectively.

**WCAG 2.2** includes a few recommendations to make content accessible to people with cognitive accessibility needs. This is the reason why the W3C created the COGA TF: to research and structure the appropriate guidelines that provide solutions to web barriers experienced by people with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities. There is already a [draft for WCAG 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/) which seems promising and shows a shift in the organisation of international guidelines to address solutions to cognitive needs.

In 2022, the European Commission issued **Mandate 587** to request a revision and the development of new standards in support of the European Accessibility Act. This includes an update for the EN 301 549. It is expected that the working group considers the new WCAG versions, and the recommendations published by the COGA TF to include more direct references and guidelines for cognitive accessibility. The report [Pilot Project Study: Inclusive Web Accessibility for Persons with Cognitive Disabilities](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/commission-publishes-study-inclusive-web-accessibility-persons-cognitive-disabilities), written by Funka and ICF and published by the EU Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, highlights three areas of improvement for the EN 301 549 that are related to cognitive accessibility:

- Visual support for orientation, navigation, operability, and understanding.
- Requirements that consider the relationship between several elements on the same page or in a process.
- Support for individual options.

Other standards mentioned in **Mandate 587** already have technical and standardisation references, including cognitive accessibility, that will support their updating. This may affect the final documents due in September 2025 and the future harmonised standards for accessibility in non-digital information, support services and emergency communications due in 2026–2027.

## 5. Easy-to-read and plain language

Written messages have dominated human communications for many centuries and with several purposes: regulations and laws, administration and justice, recruitment and employment, education and science or literature, among others. Nowadays, with the extended use of digital technologies, the volume of published content is impossible to quantify. Additionally, there is a problem on how a person can manage all this information and figure out what is relevant or not. Whenever content is prepared, there must not be the assumption that everybody can process and understand it as the author intended. This is where easy-to-read and plain language methodologies come in.

Conceptualising methodologies to make communication more efficient has been challenging because of the diversity and similarity of terms used. Easy-to-read and plain language have been finally the successful denominations among professionals and scholars. The first standards related to these methodologies include these two terms with the following definitions:

**Plain language**: A communication is in plain language if its wording, structure, and design are so clear that the intended readers can easily find what they need, understand what they find, and use that information. **ISO 24495:2023**

**Easy-to-read**: A methodology that applies a set of guidelines and recommendations related to writing and design/layout of documents and to the validation of their comprehensibility, targeted to make information accessible to persons with reading comprehension difficulties. **UNE 153101:2018 EX**

Both methodologies cover different needs. On the one hand, plain language focusses on communication efficiency. It aims to make it easier to find, understand and use relevant information. It is targeted to the general population, that is, people with reading skills, but not necessarily familiar enough with certain content and topics. It uses simple structure and everyday words. Plain language is mainly applied to legal, administrative, health, science or economic content.

Easy-to-read focusses on the accessibility of all kinds of written content (e.g. functional, health or administration-related, leisure or literature). They are intended for a specific target group, persons who find reading a challenge and tend to experience everyday content as a barrier, like people with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities, older persons, persons with hearing or visual disabilities or with low literacy. Documents in easy-to-read contain a specific structure, easy words and very clear explanations.

The **ISO/IEC 23859:2023** standard introduced a third term: easy-to-understand language. This umbrella concept covers "any language variety which enhances comprehensibility" and includes plain language, easy language and "any intermediate variety". Additionally, it considers easy language as the main term to include plain language and easy-to-read written content and easy-to-understand oral and multimodal content. Its authors consider that both plain language and easy-to-read can only be used in written texts. The latter is still under discussion among experts.

Plain language and easy-to-read require the participation of target groups in the process. In the case of the first one, **ISO 24495:2023 Plain Language. Part 1 Governing principles and guidelines** sets out the fundamentals for developing plain language documents and how they should be interpreted and applied. It states the need for users' participation to assess the documents in several stages prior to their publication. However, the tools mentioned (interviews, surveys) are less strict than the ones used for developing easy-to-read documents.

In the case of easy-to-read, as both the Spanish standard and the German draft mention, user participation is considered as part of the process and of the methodology definition. The specific term for user testing in easy-to-read is validation. It consists of a type of focus group, where a sample of trained end users, called validators, participate in a discussion about the comprehensibility of a content. Supported by a facilitator, they describe the barriers experienced, review the content, and add comments and proposals for modification to improve the comprehension. Then, the writer must consider these amendments to fulfil the comprehension purpose.

The systematisation of both methodologies started 50 years ago and culminated with the current standards. The initial plain language references and handbooks come from two sources, judicial professionals (lawyers, attorneys, judges) and translators. In the late nineties, the latter group created the EU initiative Fight the Fog and was behind the publication of the booklet [How to write clearly](https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2782/022405), which was translated into 16 official EU languages.

As for easy-to-read, Inclusion Europe and its partners in the [Pathways II](https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/pathways-2/) Erasmus project created a set of publications in 2012 to standardise the easy-to-read methodology and its application for long-life learning purposes. It created the European easy-to-read logo that is still in use and has become the main reference to identify content produced on this basis. Additionally, the Erasmus+ project ["Capito! Compris! Understood! Verstanden!"](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/es/projects/search/details/2021-2-AT01-KA220-ADU-000049164) has contributed to standardise the easy-to-read guidelines for English, French, Italian and German languages to the initial levels established by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL): A1, A2 and B1.

Erasmus+ funds have also supported specific training practices:

- [Easy Access for Social Inclusion Training (EASIT)](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/es/projects/search/details/2018-1-ES01-KA203-050275) for writers and multimodal creators who develop easy-to-understand content.

- [Professional training for easy-to-read facilitators and validators (Train2Validate)](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/es/projects/search/details/2020-1-ES01-KA203-082068) for professional training of easy-to-read validators and facilitators. The aim of this programme was the professional recognition of both easy-to-read validator and facilitator profiles in a harmonised way across Europe.

In EU Member States, Sweden has an [Agency for Accessible Media](https://www.mtm.se/english/) that took over the former Centre for Easy-to-Read and is responsible for the production of easy content in several fields, including literature, news and administration-related information. In Spain, the [Centre for Cognitive Accessibility](https://www.ceacog.es/) (CEACOG, by its Spanish acronym) was created by the aforementioned Spanish act in 2022 (see page 6) with the mandate to promote easy-to-read publications in all the fields mentioned in that regulation. CEACOG is also developing technical requirements, training and projects in other fields where cognitive accessibility is applied such as built and digital environments or services.

## 6. Cognitive Accessibility in built environment

<a id="barriers-built"></a>

### 6.1. Barriers

Moving through a space is an action with a purpose. People usually go to places with a specific goal (like purchasing a product, receiving a service or meeting someone), and may need an efficient way to do it. They may choose to follow the logical direction sequence: follow the route that is the shortest, less difficult, easier to remember. Problems may arise when their sense of direction is hindered by the environment or when the tools used are not helpful. Certain skills are triggered when a person interacts in an environment:

- **Positioning**: it helps people understand where they are.
- **Sense of direction**: it helps people find the way and arrive to the desired destination.
- **Spatial perception**: it helps people understand their environment.
- **Danger identification**: it helps people perceive and avoid possible dangerous situations, such as crossings.

Personal and cultural backgrounds also play a role when moving about a new place for the first time. This requires analogy. If a person visits a large hospital for the first time in their lives, the aforementioned skills will need more support than they would if that person has been to a similar hospital before.

The main barriers a person can experience in built environments are related to perception and information processing. Perception plays a role in how a person gathers information from an environment. In his book "The Image of the City", published in 1960 and still applicable, Kevin Lynch described that the way people perceive an environment is linked to their interaction. People try to find signs of where they are such as the type of buildings or relevant or memorable locations, among others. Signage, pictograms and language play a role in information processing. Overcoming the barriers experienced with this skill is the goal of cognitive accessibility in this field.

<a id="guidelines-and-recommendations-built"></a>

### 6.2. Guidelines and recommendations

Cognitive accessibility tools useful for built environment comprise wayfinding resources as well as signage and maps. Transversally, pictograms and language are included.

In his publication, Kevin Lynch identifies five elements that define the shape of a city and help people navigate it that are still current. These are:

- **Nodes** – places for decision-making which may require additional support to avoid frustration (crossroads, traffic circles, squares, etc.)
- **Landmarks** – easy to remember as a reference that help people find their bearings
- **Edges** – city limits such as major avenues
- **Paths** – places to move from one point to another
- **Districts** – areas with common features such as building types

These five elements can be applied to a building, e.g. a hospital with areas dedicated to different activities such as rooms for patients, operating rooms, laboratories or doctors' clinics, among others.

Taking into consideration the way Lynch defines the elements of a city together with the architectural and urban design as well as the organisation and shape of spaces in a rational and efficient way, the most immediate cognitive accessibility solutions useful for anyone are signage and maps. As discussed in section 4, there are some standards that address the design and evaluation of signage for places. The **ISO 21542:2021** provides a few cognitive indicators that are applicable to buildings, e.g., signage placed in areas easy to see and touch; legible typography; and easy to understand messages. Additionally, the **Spanish UNE 170002:2022 "Accessibility requirements for sign elements in buildings"** includes several requirements that address cognitive needs. It clarifies technical details on typography, pictograms and the use of arrows and colours as the main characteristics for signage. The German **DIN 1450:2013-04 Lettering – Legibility** standard (soon to be amended by DIN 1450/1) is complementary in that it describes the characteristics that fonts should comply with to be readable (size, proportions amongst font elements and illumination, amongst others).

There is also a systematised reference on cognitive accessibility in the built environment promoted by the Spanish Committee of People with Disabilities (CERMI, by its Spanish acronym) that includes the qualities of cognitively accessible information: easy to find, perceptible, understandable, relevant, moderated, consistent, continuous and homogeneous. These concepts are fully applicable to a signage system for built environments. In fact, all signage designs should be tested following the **ISO 9186** guidelines, which promote a methodology to check the sign comprehensibility and the association between reference and symbol.

Regarding maps, there are two main features. The first one is the selection of information. Maps that are exhaustive can be counterproductive and overwhelming for users. They are also limited in space when they are published on paper, but digital versions should not include all the details. Based on the wayfinding concepts, maps must highlight the main organisational elements (paths, areas, landmarks, etc.), allow a clear perception of the different areas, identify the main locations, show the user's position, display the necessary information, and include clear and comprehensible icons and texts. The second one is the position related to the space it shows. The rotation of the map according to the space is key for the proper orientation.

<a id="evaluation-and-good-practices-built"></a>

### 6.3. Evaluation and good practices

Cognitively accessible solutions need user experience (UX) methodologies to test their effectiveness. Therefore, to identify the right tools as proper case solutions, researchers must apply certain analytical tools before the project starts. Working with real people in real-life situations is also necessary to observe their behaviour and to implement solutions following two methodologies: itinerary analysis in field studies and decision-making analysis. The latter is based on Arthur and Passini's Wayfinding: People, Signs, and Architecture that discusses the wayfinding interaction between a person and their environment. Cognitive maps are also a tool worth mentioning because users make representations of their particular use of a space, highlighting their main references as users. This tool helps researchers plan and organise the resources needed to improve cognitive accessibility. All these tools are already used by technologies, like eye-tracking, that monitors eye movements and helps discover what is attractive to the user to make decisions on organising spaces and locating the signage.

ISO 9186 proposes a systematised methodology in which the tests are carried out after a selection of a diverse sample that must match symbols with proposed meanings. Participants should be familiarised with the environment in which pictograms will be applied. Otherwise, the test may be negatively biased. At the end, test conductors apply the pictograms that overcome a threshold of acceptance.

There is good practice published that follows this methodology: the [Pictogram Library](https://pictogramas.plenainclusion.org/) created by Plena Inclusion España (a non-profit organisation that supports the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities). It already has a collection of 250 pictograms for 31 different fields, that were evaluated following the ISO 9186 criteria.

Another good practice worth mentioning and applied to urban environment, is the [Legible London](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/boroughs-and-communities/legible-london) project. It proposes the use of monoliths to inform citizens where they are. They also show how to get to points of interest and other areas, maps referencing nearby places showing the time it takes to get there on foot (up to 15 minutes) and a clear identification of places with proper design and icons. This project is based on wayfinding criteria and applies participative methodologies and other tools such as cognitive maps.

There are a few good practices relating to the built environment focused on complex places like airports over which research has been done. Project LairA, supported by the European Union's Interreg Central Europe programme, is an interesting example. As a part of this project, a [report on wayfinding in airports](https://programme2014-20.interreg-central.eu/Content.Node/Wayfinding-WEB.pdf) was published. After researching several airports, it proposes at least 6 principles for wayfinding best practices in these facilities:

- Start the wayfinding where the passenger relies on airport information.
- Provide simple information, mainly for people unfamiliar with airports.
- Use standardised way makers.
- Provide consistent wayfinding style.
- Show the way. Lead the passenger the whole way.
- Confirm to the passenger they have reached their destination.

## 7. Cognitive accessibility in digital environments

<a id="barriers-digital"></a>

### 7.1. Barriers

Technology is one of the fields where more systematised accessibility requirements and methodologies have been produced. As discussed in section 4 of this document, the W3C WAI created the **WCAG** as an international standard with three levels of compliance: A, AA, and AAA. However, cognitive accessibility has a limited presence in all WCAG versions, even in the current 2.2.

Digitalisation opened new opportunities for everyone, and also a number of important cognitively accessible solutions, often at no or a moderate cost to the user. At the same time, it has created new barriers particularly for people with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities. As previously mentioned, the W3C created the COGA Task Force, which, after extensive research, developed the document titled [Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/). This report describes a long list of barriers that were identified after members of the COGA TF spoke with a diversity of people. Some of these barriers are the following:

- Understanding how to operate a website or the structure of the content.
- Finding information.
- Understanding both written and visual content (symbols, pictograms, buttons, controls, etc.).
- Feeling overwhelmed by too much information.
- Feeling frustrated for making mistakes and being unable to avoid and amend them.
- Distracting elements, that affect the memory and the attention.
- Lack of support such as confirmation messages.

These barriers are a summary of a longer list, and enough to point out the variety of challenges of developing a website, particularly when many of the usual resources are inadequate for this audience.

<a id="guidelines-and-recommendations-digital"></a>

### 7.2. Guidelines and recommendations

The COGA TF proposes 8 objectives with 58 patterns to increase cognitive accessibility:

1. Help users understand what things are and how to use them, with consistent design patterns and using standardised symbols and terms.
2. Help users find what they need, with a clear design that they can navigate easily.
3. Use clear and understandable content: easy words, short sentences, and supporting materials such as charts, pictures, summaries and videos.
4. Help users avoid mistakes and know how to correct them.
5. Help users focus by avoiding distractions or competing stimuli such as too much information and elements like self-playing sounds, flashing images and videos. Add resources to make content navigation easier such as breadcrumbs or clear headings.
6. Ensure processes do not rely on memory. Provide easy alternatives to login instead of long passwords.
7. Make it easy to get human help and give feedback.
8. Support adaptation and personalisation. Make websites compatible with assistive technologies, so that people with disabilities can use them.

**WCAG 2.2.** already includes a few guidelines on cognitive accessibility. The success criteria related to it are identified following the WCAG principles:

**Perceivable:**

- **1.3.5. Identify input purpose.** Make forms easier to fill out.
- **1.3.6. Identify purpose.** Make content easier to operate and navigate.
- **1.4.12. Text spacing.** Make it possible for users to adjust spacing to make the text easier to read.

**Operable:**

- **2.2.1. Timing adjustable.** Provide users with adequate time to complete tasks. They should be able to turn off, adjust or extend time limits.
- **2.5.2. Pointer cancellation.** Reduce accidental activation of controls by mouse or touch by making pointer cancellation predictable and consistent.

**Understandable:**

- **3.1.3. Unusual words.** Provide a definition for technical jargon and unusual terms.
- **3.1.4. Abbreviation.** Provide expanded forms of abbreviations.
- **3.1.5. Reading level.** When text becomes complex, create a more easily understood version.
- **3.1.6. Pronunciation.** Indicate how to pronounce words where the meaning is otherwise unclear.
- **3.2.3. Consistent navigation.** Make content navigable predictably.
- **3.2.4. Consistent identification.** Identify repeating functions consistently.
- **3.3.1. Error identification.** Provide descriptive notifications of errors.
- **3.3.3. Error suggestion.** Suggest ways to correct errors.
- **3.3.4. Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) and 3.3.6 Error Prevention (All).** Provide ways to confirm, correct or reverse submissions.

W3C published a draft of the WCAG 3.0 in May 2024 that shows a change in model compared to former versions. Authors are trying to write the guidelines in plain language to make them more understandable and meet the needs of users, specifically people with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities. Next steps are expected to show the final details and how deeply the new version will cover these needs.

Regarding digital mobile accessibility, W3C states that it is covered in existing accessibility standards and guidelines, such as **EN 301 549** that offers several requirements that can be applied to mobile devices and apps. There is a working document (still in draft since 2015) that applies the WCAG to mobiles and apps in both web and native environments. Cognitive accessibility recommendations are very limited and mostly refer to the understandable principle, specifically positioning relevant page elements before the page scroll, grouping operable elements that perform the same action, consistent layout and making actionable elements easy to identify.

<a id="evaluation-and-good-practices-digital"></a>

### 7.3. Evaluation and good practices

<a id="evaluation-methods-digital"></a>

#### 7.3.1. Evaluation methods

The Pilot Project Study: Inclusive Web-Accessibility for Persons with Cognitive Disabilities previously discussed (see section 4) proposes that end users with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities should be part of digital standardisation activities. The Commission Implementing Decision **(EU) 2018/1524** includes annexes that describe monitoring methods, both in-depth and simplified, and sets the samples of population and pages. It also provides some instructions for reporting. However, this regulation does not detail the procedures for compiling the user experience, which is key to establish if a website or app is cognitively accessible. For this purpose, the COGA TF proposes a usability testing to measure the user success in completing tasks, the time taken and satisfaction with the key tasks.

The testing procedure proposed strongly encourages the involvement of a diverse set of users with intellectual, developmental and learning disability. The document includes a set of questions focused on obtaining information about the above-mentioned abilities and to check the specific objectives of cognitive accessibility for websites. Additionally, the content analyses the differences with similar tests run with the general population. It recommends providing easy-to-understand information, adapting the testing method to the person, and making sure their needs are met and that they get the necessary support, among others. It also highlights the need to adapt the answer options, e.g. using an alternative to emojis, which are not the best way to test user satisfaction. There are also suggestions for when the tests are being carried out, e.g. reminding participants they can leave when they want, checking if the task is frustrating or annoying and asking participants to express their opinions out loud. This document also provides a detailed set of questions that researchers can ask participants in focus groups or personal interviews.

<a id="good-practices-digital"></a>

#### 7.3.2. Good practices

There are several good practices in cognitively accessible web designs that are worth highlighting.

- [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/): It is an example of easy web design, considering the amount of content that must be managed. Topics are listed with familiar wording for readers and options address users in second person ("you") instead of in third person. Content is easy to find, and it is structured in titles and short paragraphs, and written in plain language. The pages have a standard design, with a white background, black typeface with links underlined in blue, as usual.
- [Irish Government website](https://www.gov.ie/en/): It has a similar design to that of the UK government. Categories do not contain more than three options. It provides explanations for terms that can be difficult to understand, and content is written in plain English with large fonts.
- [German Parliament website](https://www.bundestag.de/leichte_sprache): It has a separate section dedicated to easy-to-read language (leichte Sprache in German) and cognitive accessibility that is accessed by clicking on a dedicated button. It offers a selection of the information provided in the original website. The text is written following the easy-to-read structure with pictures displayed in a column on the right side. The design is regular in the section, but different from the original version, with a simple menu and easy browsing.

The Horizon 2020 [Easy Reading](https://www.easyreading.eu/) project proposes another solution. Instead of changing the website's source code or design, it offers a technology that works as a layer over the website. In this layer, the user can activate different tools to help them read and understand the publications.

## 8. Cognitive accessibility in services

<a id="barriers-services"></a>

### 8.1. Barriers

Cognitive accessibility in services is a field that lacks literature and systematisation. However, there are some bases to begin a systematised approach.

The barriers are mainly in obtaining information and in communication. Some services require the interaction of a person with a device or with another person. This means that the way in which information is provided and how the customer processes it to provide feedback are key for comprehension. Another barrier has to do with understanding the entire procedure that a service involves, from the first contact to the end. For instance, many people don't understand why something happens in a court of justice. Judicial services offer unusual environments for ordinary people since they often include specific procedures and jargon. Making the full chain of procedures understandable is a goal for cognitive accessibility in services.

Additionally, the lack of training about how to interact with a diverse set of clients may also be a cognitive barrier. For example, a person with cognitive issues may find themselves faced with another person who speaks too fast, uses technical jargon and makes the client go through a complex and unfamiliar procedure. In this case, cognitive accessibility would focus more on human interaction solutions instead of technical solutions or devices.

<a id="guidelines-and-recommendations-services"></a>

### 8.2. Guidelines and recommendations

Provision of information is key to all services, and so is the role of cognitive accessibility. Information provided as part of any service (technology, financial, recruitment, telecommunications, audiovisual, transport, health and social services, justice, public administration, culture and education, etc.) must make clear both the immediate action and also its context, meaning, the whole process a person needs to go through to receive the requested services.

**European Union Directive (EU) 2019/882**, also known as the "European Accessibility Act", regulates the obligations that service providers must comply with to be accessible. The Directive contains some recommendations related to cognitive accessibility, namely:

- Information and instructions must be presented in an understandable way (Annex I, section I (1, a, ii)).
- Information and instructions must be presented in fonts of adequate size and suitable shape, taking into account foreseeable conditions of use and using sufficient contrast, as well as adjustable spacing between letters, lines and paragraphs (Annex I, section I (1, b, iv)).
- Instructions must have non-textual alternatives (Annex I, section I (1, b, vi)).
- Interfaces must provide the possibility to extend the time given (Annex I, section I (2, o, i)).
- Interfaces must not interfere with assistive devices (Annex I, section I (2, o, iii)).
- Emergency communications must support total conversation where video is provided in addition to voice communication (Annex I, section IV (a, ii)).
- Information regarding banking services must be understandable, without exceeding a language level of complexity superior to level B2 (upper intermediate) of the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL).

The above requirements are also applicable to services provided in sectors such as healthcare, justice, and education, among others. Instructions and information can be provided by voice, in person and/or in writing.

Some EU Member States, such as Spain and Ireland, have introduced the role of facilitator or intermediary to make access to justice accessible to persons with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities. The job of this professional is to help such persons understand justice procedures, including preliminary stages and communications. This role is key to guarantee equal access to justice for this population group and has become a cognitive accessibility solution.

Additionally, the **Directive 2010/13/EU**, also known as the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (and its amendment **Directive (EU) 2018/1808**), protects the rights of people with disabilities and older people "linked to the provision of accessible audiovisual media services". According to this directive, accessibility should include "sign language, subtitling, audio-description and easily understandable menu navigation". Although this list appears only in the preamble of the directive, it shows the intention that these services must be accessible, also cognitively.

Existing requirements for service providers are very general. Still, there are a few standards that provide some solutions for cognitive accessibility needs. For instance, easy information. Depending on their target groups, service providers can offer information in plain language or easy-to-read. The **ISO/IEC 23859:2023 Information technology – user interfaces – requirements and recommendations on making written text easy-to-read and understand** details some guidelines for audiovisual content. Moreover, there are Erasmus+ projects that have systematised recommendations for audiovisual and oral communication. The aforementioned Erasmus+ [Easy Access for Social Inclusion Training (EASIT)](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/es/projects/search/details/2018-1-ES01-KA203-050275) (see page 16) points out that rules are very similar to easy-to-read and plain language recommendations, e.g. logical content structure, correct sentence order, easy and frequent words. When communicating by voice, the service provider must pronounce clearly, speak more slowly than they normally would using a natural tone. Visual content must be consistent with the speech, displayed in longer shots and follow the "show and tell" strategy.

The Erasmus+ [Spoken Easy Language for Social Inclusion (SELSI)](https://selsi.eu/en/) that finished in October 2024 offers recommendations for spoken easy language. The project members have published guidelines for spoken easy language. Some of these recommendations are the following:

- Oral communication should take place in calm areas free of distraction.
- It must be clear, gentle with simple vocabulary.
- It must be respectful:
   - Making eye contact
   - Practising active listening
   - Never interrupting the other person
   - Using short sentences and easy words, avoiding technical jargon or difficult terms
   - Repeating if necessary
   - Speaking slower than usual
   - Being patient

### 8.3. Evaluation and good practices

<a id="evaluation-methods-services"></a>

#### 8.3.1. Evaluation methods

There is a general lack of cognitive accessibility solutions, methods and resources in the field of services. The standard **EN 17161:2019 Design for all – Accessibility following a design for all approach in products, goods and services** offers an extensive methodology for designing services, products and goods from a design for all approach. It states the need for user participation. It also includes an annex with recommendations about how to design activities for projects and proposes a set of questions. Additionally, this document recommends the [Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/) created by the University of Cambridge, that offers more details about the methodology and tools. However, it does not describe the particularities of working with people with intellectual, developmental and learning disabilities.

For this specific purpose, the report [Design for All Methodology: Tools to Consider Cognitive Abilities](https://biblioteca.fundaciononce.es/publicaciones/colecciones-propias/coleccion-accesibilidad/metodologia-de-diseno-para-todos), published by Fundación ONCE and the University of Mondragón (Spain), proposes a set of tools organised as a methodology that can be applied to products and services adapted to people with cognitive accessibility needs. The steps are organised in a thread beginning with an initial exploring phase to gather information about users' needs. The subsequent phases consist of creating and choosing suitable design concepts and verification and validation tests to confirm the acceptance of the solution. As in other fields, UX testing is one of the bases for the success of cognitive accessibility solutions.

<a id="good-practices-services"></a>

#### 8.3.2. Good practices

The legal facilitator mentioned in section 8.2 is one of the cognitive accessibility good practices being carried out in the area of public services. It is regulated in Ireland by the [Criminal Justice Act](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2016/121/), 2017. Madrid's regional government approved the [Decree 52/2024](https://gestiona.comunidad.madrid/wleg_pub/secure/normativas/contenidoNormativa.jsf?opcion=VerHtml&nmnorma=13649&eli=true#no-back-button), that establishes the requirements, rules of procedure, funding, the procedure for designation and a qualification that these professionals must have.

Regarding healthcare services, the [UK National Health Service (NHS)](https://www.nhs.uk/) offers in its website an A-Z repository with information on health and drugs. The information is structured in sections that attract the reader's interest and is written in simple and clear language. In Spain, Sandoz Pharma and Plena Inclusión, a Spain-based non-profit organisation specialising in cognitive accessibility, launched a similar project Salud más fácil (Easier Health). It offers leaflets with medical information written in easy-to-read. Additionally, [Informationsverige](https://www.informationsverige.se/en/hem.html), promoted by the Swedish Administration, offers information about the needs of migrants. The website is cognitively accessible, contains comprehensible content and is offered in 11 foreign languages. It focuses on the direct needs of migrants, like asylum, residence or specific information for people under 18.

<a id="challenges"></a>

## 9. Challenges

There are several challenges to cognitive accessibility. On the one hand, professionals in this field need to propose solutions for problems with intellectual abilities. These are not easy to measure and defining standards is difficult. At least there is a consensus regarding the methodology. Researchers agree that user participation is necessary to develop adequate solutions to meet real needs. However, at present obtaining data is expensive and complicated, because the diversity and complexity is enormous. As an example, the list of main beneficiaries was mentioned on page 9, and it shows a great variety. Additionally, research in cognition should not be limited to disabilities or age-related problems. It must include cultural diversity as it shapes how a person perceives and understands their environment, and this can affect some cognitive accessibility solutions, e.g. migrants that come to a country with a different language or culture.

It is not surprising that legislation on cognitive accessibility is still lacking or incomplete, while standards keep evolving. More legislation could back more research outcomes. This is why it is necessary to tackle further research on human intellectual needs to obtain measurable indicators that can reach the widest human range, considering that the diversity is enormous. In this context, more connections between experts and decision-making or political institutions are desirable. The results of this cooperation could be not only new standards or their update, as Mandate 587 appoints, but also specific research investment to develop these indicators and make cognitive solutions more efficient. From these results, current regulations could be more precise in how to apply the solutions with two purposes: users will be able to benefit from inclusion and organisations will feel more legal security to ensure that they apply the solutions properly and avoid sanctions.

There is some consensus regarding signage, pictograms, websites and easy content, as the standardisation documents show. However, there are several aspects that still need clarification. For instance, how often signage should appear, how many pictograms are acceptable for signage in order to be operative and not challenging for learning abilities, or if the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL) criteria are also applicable for nationals with comprehension difficulties, as it is for foreigners learning a new language. Of course, more research is needed on quantitative criteria and to create the necessary steps to interpret qualitative data to avoid subjective results.

On the other hand, more research is needed on cognitive accessibility needs in products, services, built and urban environments. Although some methodologies have obtained good results, subjectivity in the application of solutions is still a problem. For instance, many people consider that cognitive accessibility in built environment is a simple question of signage. They fail to see that the structure of buildings and their distribution play a relevant role. One question to solve is how architecture and accessibility professionals can establish appropriate and measurable indicators.

On a positive note, accessibility experts and other professionals are becoming increasingly aware about the need to avoid common problems such as incomprehensible content, websites that are hard to navigate or labyrinthic spaces. Researchers have an extensive field before them to develop indicators, consolidate criteria, create tools and promote efficient solutions to prevent indirect discrimination the absence of accessibility implies and achieve the full inclusion of everyone regardless their cognitive abilities.
